escapement animation with FreeCAD, assembly4, Python

I designed a 3D printed clock and was wondering If I would be able to animate the escapment with FreeCAD
Well Yes, here it is

I included the FreeCAD files as well as the Python code Macro if you want to give it a go
They are plenty of comment in code to folow the idea
Open the file in freeCAD 0,19
Go to the Assembly 4 workbench, ( tools, addon if you don't have it)
load the Python file as a macro
open the the Python console, copy and paste the file, press Enter, That is it!
